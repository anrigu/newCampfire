# New Campfire

Our team is expanding upon our initial project and MVP [Campfire](https://campfireconvos.com/)! Currently, we are designing and building a tool designed to connect users with literature that stands at the intersection of different genres. Today's library's use outdated search algorithms that limit users to search by authors, titles, or a genre keywords. We're designing our own seach algorithm based on a user's customized interests and desired keywords to help connect them with the proper sources of information. In this way, we expand and help users find the literature that they need and desire!
